    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort?

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

    "section": "5.3 Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot",
    "text": "5.3 Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nFor example:\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe function geom_density_ridges() from the ggridges package is used to create Ridgeline Density Plots, which visualize the distribution of a numerical variable across multiple categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nscale = 3\nAdjusts the height of the ridgelines. A higher value increases the separation between ridges.\n\n\nrel_min_height = 0.01\nControls the minimum height of density estimates, ensuring that small peaks are not filtered out.\n\n\nbandwidth = 3.4\nDefines the smoothness of the density curves. Higher values make the curves smoother, while lower values preserve more details.\n\n\nfill = lighten(“#7097BB”, .3)\nSpecifies the fill color of the ridgelines, with lighten() making the blue (#7097BB) 30% lighter.\n\n\ncolor = “white”\nSets the outline color of the ridgelines to white, making the edges more distinct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp. [F]\",\n                       option = \"C\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_density_ridges_gradient() + scale_fill_viridis_c() Detailed Explanation\n\n\n\nThis part of the code creates a ridgeline density plot with a gradient color effect, where the fill color changes based on the x-axis values (ENGLISH scores).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nscale = 3\nControls the height of ridgelines. Higher values increase the separation between ridges.\n\n\nrel_min_height = 0.01\nSets the minimum height of density estimates, preventing small peaks from being removed.\n\n\nGradient Effect\nUses fill = stat(x) (set in aes()) to color the ridges based on the x-axis values (ENGLISH scores).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Mapping the probabilities directly onto colour\nBeside providing additional geom objects to support the need to plot ridgeline plot, ggridges package also provides a stat function called stat_density_ridges() that replaces stat_density() of ggplot2.\nFigure below is plotted by mapping the probabilities calculated by using stat(ecdf) which represent the empirical cumulative density function for the distribution of English score.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = 0.5 -

stat(ecdf)\nMeasures the distance of a score’s probability from the center (0.5).\n\n\nabs(0.5 - stat(ecdf))\nEnsures that both low and high values move away from the center symmetrically.\n\n\n0.5 - abs(0.5 - stat(ecdf))\nConverts the formula so that middle values (~0.5 ECDF) get the highest fill values (lighter color), while extreme values (~0 or 1 ECDF) get lower fill values (darker color).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstat_density_ridges(geom = “density_ridges_gradient”, calc_ecdf = TRUE)\n\n\n\nThis function is responsible for drawing the ridgeline density plot while allowing color to vary across the distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\ngeom = “density_ridges_gradient”\nUses a smooth color gradient instead of solid fills.\n\n\ncalc_ecdf = TRUE\nComputes the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) to allow probability-based coloring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscale_fill_viridis_c(name = “Tail probability”, direction = -1)\n\n\n\nThis function applies a color scale to the fill values computed earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nname = “Tail probability”\nRenames the legend to indicate it represents tail probability.\n\n\ndirection = -1\nReverses the Viridis color scale so that extreme values (tails) appear lighter, while middle values appear darker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is important include the argument calc_ecdf = TRUE in stat_density_ridges().\n\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Ridgeline plots with quantile lines\nBy using geom_density_ridges_gradient(), we can colour the ridgeline plot by quantile, via the calculated stat(quantile) aesthetic as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = \"Quartiles\") +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstat_density_ridges() – Compute Density and Add Quantile Lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngeom = “density_ridges_gradient”\nUses gradient colors for the ridgelines (allows color variation).\n\n\ncalc_ecdf = TRUE\nComputes the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) to assign colors based on probability.\n\n\nquantiles = 4\nDivides the distribution into four quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).\n\n\nquantile_lines = TRUE\nAdds vertical lines at the quartile boundaries on each ridge to help visualize data distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscale_fill_viridis_d() – Apply Color Scale\n\n\n\n\nUses a discrete (d) viridis color scale to color different quartile regions distinctly.\nColors correspond to different quartile ranges, making it easier to interpret the distribution.\nname = \"Quartiles\" sets the legend title to \"Quartiles\" to indicate that the colors represent quartile divisions.\n\n\n\nInstead of using number to define the quantiles, we can also specify quantiles by cut points such as 2.5% and 97.5% tails to colour the ridgeline plot as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = c(0.025, 0.975)\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Probability\",\n    values = c(\"#FF0000A0\", \"#A0A0A0A0\", \"#0000FFA0\"),\n    labels = c(\"(0, 0.025]\", \"(0.025, 0.975]\", \"(0.975, 1]\")\n  ) +\n  theme_ridges()"

    "text": "5.4 Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”.

The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\n\n5.4.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstat_halfeye()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nFunction\n\n\n\n\nadjust = 0.5\nControls the smoothness of the density curve.

    "text": "7.4 Visualising Uncertainty: ggdist package\n\nggdist is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty.\nIt is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization:\n\nfor frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette(“freq-uncertainty-vis”));\nfor Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist).\n\n\n\n\n7.4.1 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods\nIn the code chunk below, stat_pointinterval() of ggdist is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.\n\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, \n             y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis function comes with many arguments, students are advised to read the syntax reference for more detail.\n\n\nFor example, in the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\n.width = 0.95\n.point = median\n.interval = qi\n\n\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.95,\n  .point = median,\n  .interval = qi) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of median math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Median Point + Multiple-interval plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstat_pointinterval()\n\n\n\n\n.width = 0.95\n→ Specifies a 95% confidence interval (indicating that the interval represents a 95% credible region).\n.point = median\n→ Uses the median as the representative value (instead of the mean).\n.interval = qi\n→ Uses qi (highest density interval, HDI) to calculate the interval. This is a Bayesian statistical method for estimating credible intervals (different from traditional confidence intervals).\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods\n\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.99,\n  .point = median,\n  .interval = qi) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of median math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Median Point + Multiple-interval plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, \n             y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_pointinterval(\n    show.legend = FALSE) +   \n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshow.legend = FALSE\n\n\n\n\nshow.legend is a parameter that controls whether the legend for that specific layer (in this case, the point-interval plot) is displayed.\nshow.legend = FALSE means that the legend will not be shown for this specific layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdist methods\nIn the code chunk below, stat_gradientinterval() of ggdist is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.\n\nexam %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, \n             y = MATHS)) +\n  stat_gradientinterval(   \n    fill = \"skyblue\",      \n    show.legend = TRUE     \n  ) +                        \n  labs(\n    title = \"Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score\",\n    subtitle = \"Gradient + interval plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstat_gradientinterval()\n\n\n\nis a statistical layer in ggplot2 used to create plots with gradient-filled intervals, often used for visualizing interval estimates, with color representing different ranges of the interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstat_pointinterval() vs stat_gradientinterval()\n\n\n\n\nKey Differences:\n\nAppearance:\n\nstat_pointinterval() uses lines (or points) with intervals shown as segments around the point.\nstat_gradientinterval() uses gradient-filled intervals to represent uncertainty, often creating a smoother, more visually continuous display.\n\nFocus:\n\nstat_pointinterval() focuses on displaying the point estimate (e.g., median) and its surrounding interval.\nstat_gradientinterval() focuses on showing the distribution or uncertainty with a gradient that changes across the interval.\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\nstat_pointinterval() is for plotting point estimates with intervals (e.g., confidence/credible intervals).\nstat_gradientinterval() is for plotting intervals with gradient fills to emphasize the distribution or uncertainty."

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n6.3.5 How to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.
